Specimen is an international event about contemporary developments in typography. Its first edition will take place in Amsterdam, in the renowned bookshop San Serriffe in the center of the city

In San Serriffe the project is presented by Loraine Furter (CH), designer and researcher. There are presentations of the work of the Dutch type designer and programmer Eric Schrijver and the French type designer and graphic designer Charles Mazé. Loraine will then lead a discussion. Finally the online platform http://specimen.meteor.com is presented.

Specimen takes place shortly after AtypI, the yearly symposium of the Association Typographique Internationale reaches Amsterdam. The ATypI represents a very traditional and conservative approach to typography, and it is expensive to partake in the symposium. Specimen is an accessible platform for new developments such as collaborative design projects and font remixes made possible by the culture of open source and web 2.0. In this sense specimen will act as a PostScript to ATypI, or an ATypI-off.

Specimen is both an online project and a series of international public events. The web platform is a growing collection of essays on contemporary open source typefaces. Specimen refers to what in Dutch is a ‘letterproef’: a poster or page laid out to show a specific typeface in use. The essays take on the form of a specimen for the typefaces they treat, choosing a specific form in line with the history and cultural implications of the typeface and the way in which it has been developed.

Amsterdam is home to a lively design scene with a world wide reputation. The design of typefaces, however, remains the terrain of a small scene of type designers, more often living in Arnhem or The Hague. Specimen aims to make more accessible the world of type design to graphic designers, design students, and everyone interested in our visual culture.
